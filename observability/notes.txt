Aggregator:
Aggregation in PromQL allows you to combine multiple time series into a single one, based on certain labels.
eg: sum(rate(node_cpu_seconds_total[5m]))
This query aggregates the CPU usage across all nodes.

avg(container_memory_usage_bytes) by (namespace)
This query provides the average memory usage grouped by namespace.
